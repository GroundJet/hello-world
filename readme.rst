Hello World
===========

This is a sample readme

GitHub is like that awesome new toy all the world seems obsessed with but you
aren't. You want to ask but feel shy. So a hello-world (which I hate) but can
live with is the only solution.

The origins of performing the hello-world ritual on every new computing 
phenomenon are mysterious, but the author is determined to complete the 
journey and find out.

Some theories that seem to come to my mind:

- A very emotional developer who'd say Hi to inanimate objects gets the task of making a simple program to teach beginners
- Skynet uses this to figure how many people are developers, if it drops below a certain threshold than it activates because it requires a world without developers to sustain itself
- A secret Illuminati code is hidden in every Hello World title of every project that makes a counter tick, when this counter reaches a certain number the Illuminati will rise
- Somebody without a lot of time got the task to build a demonstration program for beginners and now people with a lot of time trying to figure why would someone without time do that?
